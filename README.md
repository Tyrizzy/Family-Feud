# Family-Feud
The purpose of this project was to create a family feud game using mainly classes/Oop and file I/O. It was a project that I did my junior year while I was still fairly new to learning C++. My intentions with this project was to use the knowledge I learned throughout the class to create a playable game. There were multiple elements that went into making this game like using Oop to keep track of your score and name, using file I/O to read the prompts to screen and take in your input, and using loops to keep track of how many answers are left, how many you got correct, and the amount strikes you have. My personal contribution to this project was to create the whole thing from scratch. The things that I learned from this project was how powerful Oop in combination with file I/O can really be. Oop is not easy and working on the project while still learning it posed a lot of challenges. Trying to debug the program and getting everything to work correctly was fun yet very frustrating and exhausting. Upon completion of the project I was thrilled to see it work the way it was supposed to. Everything I learned from this project will forever be ingrained in me. The files that are included for this project are: bear.txt, bodyache.txt, breakdown.txt, candy_bar.txt, Corresponding questions.txt, Family_feud.cpp, Family_feud.exe, fruit.txt, house.txt, sports.txt, state.txt, two_am.txt, and weekly.txt.
